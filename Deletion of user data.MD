Last updated: [2024/01/25]

How can users delete their data in the Hot Wheels Collection App?

In the App we go to settings.

On the settings screen we have the options "Delete cloud account" and "Delete local data".

Delete local data allows you to delete local data stored on the device.

Delete cloud account allows you to delete user data stored in the cloud. This will delete both the logged in data and the user's collections and wishlists.
